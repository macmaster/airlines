Are airline companies ripping us off?
Let's do some financial / data analysis to find out.

## Market Share
Largest 4 airlines in the USA control about 70-80% of the industry passenger traffic.

| Rank | Airline | Stock Ticker | Passengers (2016) |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. | American Airlines  | AAL |  198,714,575 |
| 2. | United Airlines    | UAL |  183,741,787 |
| 3. | Southwest Airlines | LUV |  151,740,357 |
| 4. | Delta Airlines     | DAL |  143,177,000 |


## Operating Margins
How profitable is it to operate an airline?  
What about other companies? (apple computer? general electric? coca-cola? walmart? etc...)  

#### Airlines (2011-2016)
| Rank | Airline | Operating Income (Margin) | Profit (Margin) | Tax Rate |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| 1. | American Airlines  | $18.694B (7.79%) | $8.455B (3.42%) |  -15.65%  |
| 2. | United Airlines    | $14.997B (6.64%) | $11.433B (5.06%) |  -16.24%  |
| 3. | Southwest Airlines | $14.811B (11.62%) | $8.066B (6.33%) |  +37.48%  |
| 4. | Delta Airlines     | $24.510B (14.05%) | $21.961B (12.31%) |  -14.46%  |

*Taxes and the Profitability of an Airline:*
```It looks like the airlines are paying no taxes or reaping gigantic government subsidies. The truth is much more nuanced.   Some years they pay the full rate (>35%), but once in a while they'll claim a giagantic tax benefit.  
These are carry-forward losses on net income dating back to 2008-2009ish.  
Throughout that recession, airlines were slammed with billions in losses, and the price of oil was sky high (~$140/barrel).    
American and United claimed huge tax benefits in 2015 (around 3B each).  
Delta normally pays close to the normal rate, but it claimed a huge 8B tax benefit in 2013.  
It may be beneficial to observer a window larger than 2011-2016.  

If I were to buy one of these four stocks, I might buy the Southwest Airlines stock.  
It has demonstrated steady revenue growth, and it has yet to expand into international markets.  
If I were to short one of these four stocks, I might short the United or American Airlines stocks.  
Particularly, United seems to have the least control over its costs, and its revenues are steadily shrinking each year.  
However, I'm an engineer, not a stock broker. If I understood airline stocks, I would be a millionaire...  

The profitability of an airline is heavily dependent on the price of oil.  
$45/barrel oil vs. $90/barrel oil could mean the difference between $5B and $10B in fuel costs.  
This could be the difference between a $2B annual operating profit and a $3B operating loss. 
In order to moderate rapid price movements in airfare that track the price of oil, the airlines purchase oil futures.  
Futures allow them to lock in today's oil price and purchase the barrel of oil at a later date.  
In this respect, airfare hikes will always lag giangantic spikes in the price of oil.

## Airfare
How has the price of an airline ticket changed from 1993 - 2016?  
What about things that lower the value of a ticket not factored into price? (switch dates, check baggage, etc..)  

## Service
What do Americans think of air travel today vs. yesterday?  
Are they willing to accept lower quality-of-service for cheaper ticket prices?  

## Government Intervention
Can the government do it better? Should we open a government-run airline?  
How efficient are government run services? (post office, military, fannie and freddie, etc..)
