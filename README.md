Are airline companies ripping us off?
Let's do some financial / data analysis to find out.

## Market Share
Largest 4 airlines in the USA control about 70-80% of the industry passenger traffic.
1. American Airlines (AAL)   198,714,575 (2016)  
2. United Airlines (UAL)     183,741,787 (2016)
3. Southwest Airlines (LUV)  151,740,357 (2016)
4. Delta Airlines (DAL)      143,177,000 (2016)

## Operating Margins
How profitable is it to operate an airline?
What about other companies? (apple computer? general electric? coca-cola? walmart? etc...)

## Airfare
How has the price of an airline ticket changed from 1993 - 2016?
What about things that lower the value of a ticket not factored into price? (switch dates, check baggage, etc..)

## Airline Service
What do Americans think of air travel today vs. yesterday?
Are they willing to accept lower quality-of-service for cheaper ticket prices?

## Government Intervention
Can the government do it better? Should we open a government-run airline?
How efficient are government run services? (post office, military, fannie and freddie, etc..)
